# Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that change
# each time through a loop. These iteration variables move through the sequence
# or set

# the iteration varaible "iterates" through the sequence (ordered set)
# the block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence
# the iteration variable moves through all the values in the sequence

# for loop
# wish every friend a "Happy new year"

friends = ["John", "Glenn", "Sally"]
for friend in friends:
# friend is the loop variable like i
# friends is the array
    print friend,", Happy new year"

print "done"
